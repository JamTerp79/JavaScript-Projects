3-13-23 --> A new adventure with a new language!


We created several applications.  A calculator, a tic-tac-toe game, and a pizza
menu.  

I did NOT save all of them in this repository....

Calculator:
A basic web version 4 function calculator.  

Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
Classic game with some political humor.  It randomly rolls dice to select first player.  Winner is celebrated with music.

Pizza Menu:
Order pizza with various selection of toppings.  The information is updated and displayed as price.
